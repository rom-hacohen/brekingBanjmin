    Make sure you get there first
    The apple of your eye
    The rotten core inside
    We are all prisoners
    Things couldn't get much worse
    I've had it up to here
    You know your end is near
    <br><br>
    You had to have it all
    Well have you had enough?
    You greedy little bastard
    You will get what you deserve
    When all is said and done
    I will be the one
    To leave you in your misery
    And hate what you've become
    <br><br>
    Intoxicated eyes
    No longer live that life
    You should have learned by now
    I'll burn this whole world down
    I need some peace of mind
    No fear of what's behind
    You think you've won this fight
    You've only lost your mind
    <br><br>
    You had to have it all
    Well have you had enough?
    You greedy little bastard
    You will get what you deserve
    When all is said and done
    I will be the one
    To leave you in your misery
    And hate what you've become
    <br><br>
    Hold me down
    (I will live again)
    Pull me out
    (I will break it in)
    Hold me down
    (Better in the end)
    Hold me down
    <br>
    You had to have it all
    Well have you had enough?
    You greedy little bastard
    You will get what you deserve
    When all is said and done
    I will be the one
    To leave you in your misery
    And hate what you've become
    <br>
    Heaven help you
    Heaven help you</p>
